# El Capitan Project

## Overview

As the demand of aquaculture and water resources is increasing in the world the algal bloom problem becomes more and more severe these days. El Capitan is a project aimed at developing a research tool to predict the algal bloom population(concentration). It also classify them into different categories and provide a visualization of the data giving a clear insight of the data.

## Features

The project has the following features:

- Feature 1: Algal Bloom Prediction
- Feature 2: Algal Bloom Classification and suggestion
- Feature 3: Authenticated User Access and Clean UI
- Feature 4: Data Visualization

## Installation

To install and set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:santoshyadav-29/El--Capitan.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd el-capitan
```

3. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

To start using the project, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Orginaity

This project is orginally developed for MBMC **IdeaX** 2024 hackathon. This is our original content and we have not copied from any source.
The idea of this project was inspired from different research papers as we researched about aquaculture in our past projects.

## Technologies

The project is built using the following technologies:

- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- NodeJs
- Clerk
- Sadcn/ui
- Recharts
- Roboflow
- Hugging Face
- python
- FastAPI
- Docker

## Frontend

The frontend of the project is built using React and Tailwind CSS. The frontend is responsible for the user interface and user interaction.

## Backend

The backend of the project is built using NodeJs. The backend is responsible for handling the requests from the frontend and communicating with the ML model.

## ML Model

The ML model is built using FastAPI and Python. The model is responsible for predicting the algal bloom population and classifying them into different categories. The Model is trained using Roboflow and Hugging Face.
